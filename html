        <p>Why should you even care? Nobody else does right?</p>
        <p>What does that matter? Why would we even have to begin to consider what somebody else thinks. You shouldn't think of them with negative things, so don't bring them into your positive goals.</p>

        <p>This really is the back bone of so much of your improvement. Helping energy levels, skin condition, gut health and of course weight. Areas of focus may be: </p>
        <li>Increase your protein intake</li>
        <li>Lower your carb intake</li>
        <li>Increase your water intake</li>

        <p>Time to get into the nitty gritty. We'll start slowly, easing into less familiar exercises that are going to target your goals and boost your confidence.</p>
        <p>Don't feel that pressure to rush off. Consistency is everything. As Tony Robins said, and I'm paraphrasing here, "Most people overestimate what they can achieve in a year, and wildly underestimate what they can achieve in a lifetime. There's time." You might split your week over 3 days of exercise, e.g.:</p>
        <li>Mon: Legs</li>
        <li>Wed: Torso + Cardio</li>
        <li>Fri: HIIT</li>

        <p>Here we want to be crystal clear we precisely what we don't want to happen, and what we do want to happen. Carrot and stick. I can't reccomend enough as some extra homework, going away and sitting through Jordan Peterson's Future Authoring Programme. Takes maybe a couple of hours, but it'll set you on the right path for life.</p>

        <p>Here you want these to do two things. Entertain you. Reflect something about you. For instance my main one is Scuba Diving. It takes a full half day to get a decent one in from where I am and it's my favourite place in the world to be. It's also taken patience and frugality to learn and save for the courses and equipment to make myself self sufficient. This reflects well in a CV or job interview or just when making conversation as it shows desirable skills people hope to emulate or share in.</p>

        <p>Here again we'll need to outsource to greater minds than mine. I myself lean heavily on my wife to guide me in this instance. But before her it was apps, blogs and friends.</p>
        <p>As a part of your goal setting you'll have come to understand an idea of how you want to present to the world. Perhaps your new wardrobe is the best way to begin reflecting this.</p>
        <li>Find inspiration</li>
        <li>Focus on what it is you like about it</li>
        <li>Make it your own</li>

        <p>That's it for now. Just a few areas to get yourself started. The keen will think to jump straight in and get it all done in an evening, leave the notpad on the side or tucked safely on your desktop. To never look at it again.</p>
        <p>I'd suggest scheduling. Open up your google calender and set yourself 30min tasks to work on each of them, perhaps every morning as a way to start a new early bird schedule to get shit done before anyone else is even awake. Now go get 'em.</p>
